# Detecting-Phishing-mail
This Project is done to detect Phishing Email using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Random Forest Classisfier(RFC).


### Problem Statement

Phishing emails pose a major threat to individuals and organizations globally, as they aim to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information or taking harmful actions. It is essential to detect and prevent phishing emails to protect personal and financial security. 
Recently, machine learning techniques have shown promise in addressing this increasing threat. The dataset includes the text body of emails and their classifications, enabling the detection of phishing emails through detailed analysis and machine learning-based classification.

The project phases include:

Data importation
Data cleaning
Data preprocessing
Models building
Model evaluation and comparison
Model selection
